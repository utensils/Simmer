# Simmer

Passive log monitoring for macOS with subtle visual feedback.

## What is Simmer?

Simmer lives in your menu bar and watches log files for patterns you care about. When it finds a match, the icon subtly glows or pulses. No intrusive notifications, no terminal overloadâ€”just ambient awareness of your systems.

Perfect for monitoring verbose worker queues, background jobs, or any logs that would otherwise flood your terminal during development.

## Status

- Watch multiple log files simultaneously
